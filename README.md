# Magicite - Remake

This project is my attempt to rebuild the game [Magicite](https://store.steampowered.com/app/268750/Magicite/) removing some bugs (such as skipping districts when pressing "W" multiple times when entering a district) and, if possible, add more features (at least make it extendable to new features like addons). It is currently being made with [ggez](https://github.com/ggez/ggez) framework in the Rust programming language.

# Support

Unfortunately there is no way to support the project **yet**, but there will be soon!
